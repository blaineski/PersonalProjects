In Quality Assurance and Testing we are using cutting-edge technology, platforms and ways of working to help development teams meet user needs and make delivery of new services even better. We’re setting high standards and changing the way we test digital services in the Home Office.  

To help us meet this challenge we're investing in our people and [we’re hiring at all levels of our organisation – from interns to heads of practice](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWNsYXNzPUpvYnMmcGFnZWFjdGlvbj1zZWFyY2hieWNvbnRleHRpZCZrZXk9ZmFpciZ1c2Vyc2VhcmNoY29udGV4dD00OTQ0MTI3MyZyZXFzaWc9MTUxNDk4NDc1Mi04MTYyZDgwNGJiYzgwNGE3NWQxZjMwODBhOGIyYWVkMTc1M2Q5ODgw)

## Quality assurance and testing

Quality assurance and testing (QAT) is a really important part of the Home Office mission. Everyone is responsible for quality and we have a team of skilled people who make sure quality is delivered in the most effective way. This means getting fast feedback, understanding how a service performs, and helping the development team to make informed decisions.

We value automating as much of the test effort as possible and run our test suites as part of continuous integration. By running our tests every time we make a change we can find defects more quickly.  We also use knowledge, experience and intuition to check systems manually when we need to - often done by experienced quality assurance testers or specialists users as part of exploratory testing.

We need to test services regularly as part of quality assurance to make sure they:

* are easy to use for anyone who needs to use it, regardless of the device they’re using
* are stable, secure and work quickly, regardless of how many people need to use it
* can be iterated quickly to meet changes to user needs or the political environment

For us, it's about testing the usability of the service as well as the technical parts. This helps to get faster feedback which means the team can make quick decisions about the service.

## Test engineering

Test engineering is an important part of our quality assurance approach. During development our test engineers help us to check that:

* code works the way it is expected to
* services are protected against security threats
* changes to the code haven't broken existing functionality

### Using the right tools

Our approach to test automation needs different tools.  We often use open source tools like Selenium for front-end automation and RestAssured for testing APIs.  We automate builds to helps us control dependencies and configuration of our frameworks.  Our tools for test automation are increasingly integrated with the deployment train, which means working really closely with developers to make sure we're doing the right things.


### Writing code

Our test engineers often have experience writing test automation libraries or frameworks using object-oriented development in languages like Java, C# and Scala.  It's important that our automated tests are treated as part of the project code base so the standards need to be the same.  It also helps that our test engineers are familiar with the development langauge which can make the process of development and testing much quicker.
